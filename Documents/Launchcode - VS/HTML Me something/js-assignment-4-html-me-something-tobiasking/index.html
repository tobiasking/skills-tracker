               <h2>Piha, New Zealand</h2>
                  <p>
                   The best thing about New Zealand is it's beaches. Nestled away in the Waitakere mountains, Piha is the best of them all.
                   A treacherous ride down the mountains brings you to a huge beach surrounded with beach houses and split down the middle with a huge rock.
                   Known as Lion's Rock, this peculiar landmark has been closed off to the public for decades due to dangerous diving/trespassing on the top of the rock.
                   Piha boasts some of the best surf on the West coast of New Zealand, and has a long, low beach that goes up almost a mile before reaching the shoreline.
                   Along the beach you can find all kind of small crabs and native fauna - perhaps my favorite thing about the beach as a child.
                   To this day it remains a popular place to get a drink, surf, body board, and even paddle up the river. If you're lucky, you can even find
                   some native fish just a little biut up the river that leads down into the bay. I remember almost drowning trying to get at the 
                   tiny fish that call that body of water their home. As I grew up, my motivations for going changed significantly, but it always remained an
                   incredibly special place to me. Most recently, a high-school friend of mine decided to move out there and buy a house - and chase a fantasy of becoming
                   a full time life guard. The great this about this was being able to enjoy the <strong> free beers at the surf life-saving house at the beach front.</strong>
                  Nothing like a glass of New Zealand's finest, <u> Steinlager</u>, after a long day.

               <h2>Rehoboth Beach, Delaware</h2>
                  <p>
                   Now this beach is loved for almost the entire opposite reasons for me. It is the bold faced tourism and consumerism that holds such a 
                   high place in my heart. That, and the fact that it was a staple of my childhood as it was that of my mother's before me. Rehoboth is a fairly
                   basic beach (in fact, I would go as far as to say that the nearby Lewes beach far surpasses it in terms of the water and swimming), but what it <b> DOES</b> 
                   have going for it is one of the <strong> coolest boardwalks I have ever seen </strong>. My favourite place is a tiny arcade, ingenously named <em> Funland. </em>
                   Funland has arcade games, a number of rides, and even a Haunted House. My favorite ride as a kid (and to this day!) was always the pirate ship, because at the apex
                   of the ride's height you would be able to see out to sea and the nauseating infinity of the horizon over the ocean. Magical stuff, really. The best part of 
                   being a parent is being able to take my kids down to Rehoboth in the summer - something we are really excited for this year! My 10 year old daughter
                   was not able to take her head out from between her legs on the Pirate Ship last time - so hopefully we can share our experience of the view together this
                   year! Thankfully, my 2 year old has been content thus far in violently throwing ski balls at the "goals" at the end of the game's track so he will be
                   a very happy camper come this year's visit.

               <h2>New York City, New York</h2>
                  <p>
                   Hardly coming in with an original take here, but New York City has been one of my favorite places in the world since I was very little. Whilst I
                   am <b> SIGNIFICANTLY</b> less comfortable dealing with crowds than I was in my youth, I somehow seem to be able to overcome and adapt every time
                   we make it out to the city. Unfortunately, as I am no longer a dependent who has my parent's finances behind me, this has been quite a bit
                   less often than it was when I was a child, but it is still the best place to go for a week or even just a weekend with the family to ride on a couple subways,
                   trepidatiously step over puddles of vomit and other forms of human waste, and go to my favorite Ramen place in the country (<em>Kuu Ramen</em>,
                   should you ever find yourself in the area). One of the things that I love the best about the city is that it is one of the few in the world
                   where you can go and visit a DECENT sized zoo (okay, so it's not <b> objectively </b> the most impressive) right in the middle of the metropolis. It also 
                   stands with a couple other places in the world where you can navigate the city by Starbucks&reg; alone. Here in New Jersey, you can basically navigate
                   by Dunkin Donut's alone but it's not quite the same (I <em>HATE</em> Dunkin Donuts). All in all, its one of the best places to go, relax, eat, drink and
                   generally enjoy the excesses of consumption that our means don't usually afford us.
